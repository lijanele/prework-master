# Chapter 3: CSS
The third step of becoming a web developer involves the use of CSS: *The language that adds style to web-pages.*

## Objectives
We've defined the following objectives:

After this chapter, students will...

1. [understand CSS][1]
2. [understand Floats][2]
3. [push their work to Github][3]

### 1 of 3: CSS
CSS uses HTML tags and attributes to style a web-page. The number of styles and the combination of their uses is both impressive and overwhelming. To give you a brief introduction to the basics of CSS, please complete [Lesson 3: Getting to know CSS][11]. To gain some interactive experience with CSS, please try [CSS Diner][12].

With this knowledge of CSS, apply alternating color to the rows of movies in your result's page of IMDB.

### 2 of 3: Floats
Changing the position of content on a web-page is common task. In order to create an accurate layout of the result's page of IMDB, you'll need to learn how to do this. To help you achieve this goal, please complete [Lesson 5: Positioning Content][21].

After you complete this lesson, add the appropriate CSS to create two columns for your result's page.

- Column 1
  - Titles
  - Names
  - Keywords
  - Companies
- Column 2
  - Category Search
  - Additional Search Options

### 3 of 3: Push to Github
You now have style, and we want to see it. Please follow these instructions:

1. Inside of `3_css/your-solution`, please create a folder with the following naming convention: [lastName-firstName].
2. Create a file named `index.html` and a file named `style.css`.
3. Add your HTML and CSS to its corresponding file.
4. Push your code to your fork of this repository.
5. Submit a pull request.
6. Wait for an [air high-five][31].  

## Conclusion
Awesome, you've added style to your HTML. Our page looks good, but it's static--the content and style never changes. To add interactivity to our result's page, we want to add JavaScript. Let's take the next step: [Chapter 4: JavaScript][next-page].
