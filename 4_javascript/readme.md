1. [complete Code School's Introduction to JavaScript][11]
2. [complete Code Academy's Introduction to JavaScript][21]

### 1 of 2: Code School
This company teaches technical topics through videos and interactive exercises. Their introduction to JavaScript is pretty good, and we would like you to complete [JavaScript Road Trip Part: 1][11].

### 2 of 2: Code Academy
This company teaches users how to code through interactive exercises. Unlike Code School, you'll be spending the majority of your time typing code into their interactive console--and not watching videos.

Please complete all the lessons in their [JavaScript Path][21].
